# Tennis Ball Tracking

This project implements various methods for tracking tennis balls in video footage, including classical computer vision techniques, Kalman filtering, and deep learning approaches using YOLO and TrackNet models.

## Project Structure

- `configs/`: Configuration files for models and experiments
- `data/`: Raw data including videos, annotations, and training datasets
- `docs/`: Project documentation
- `models/`: Trained model weights
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for exploration and visualization
- `results/`: Output from experiments
- `scripts/`: Standalone executable Python scripts
- `src/`: Main source code package

## Setup

1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Configure your models in `configs/`
3. Run tracking: `python scripts/run_tracking.py`

## Usage

See individual scripts and notebooks for detailed usage instructions.
